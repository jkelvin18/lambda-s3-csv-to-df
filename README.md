# S3 Data Processing Script

This Python script is designed to fetch the most recent S3 object from a given bucket, with a specific prefix and substring in the object name. The contents of the object are then read into a Pandas dataframe with specified schema.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- AWS account credentials with permission to access the S3 bucket and object

## Usage

1. Replace `your-bucket-name` with the name of the S3 bucket you want to access.
2. Replace `your-substring` with the substring you want to match in the S3 object name.
3. Update `schema` with the desired column names for the Pandas dataframe.
4. Save the script as `data_processing_script.py`.
5. Run the script using your preferred Python interpreter or runtime environment.

## Code Explanation

The script uses the `boto3` library to create an S3 client, which is then used to fetch a list of S3 objects that match the given prefix. The list is filtered to include only those objects with the specified substring in their name. If no objects match the prefix and substring, a `ValueError` is raised.

The script then determines the most recent object in the filtered list based on the `LastModified` property, and returns the object key (name).

Finally, the script retrieves the object contents using the S3 client and reads them into a Pandas dataframe with the specified schema. The dataframe is then returned in dictionary format.
